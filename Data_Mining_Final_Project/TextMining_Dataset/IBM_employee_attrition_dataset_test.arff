Positive, "Learned a lot friendly people"
Positive, "Opportunities growth mindset development achievements"
Positive, "Joined as a grad I was provided good mentoring and tools to succeed at the job"
Positive, "Good pay Benefits Career growth"
Positive, "A lot of what Im writing below of course depends on the work area and management chain But I found this to be fairly pervasive policies in IBM in my 9 years with the company 1 IBMs policies and management are very flexible when it comes to working remotely or accommodating various life situations sick days doctor visits etc Management is encouraged to measure an employee by their work and impact and not by hours spent at their office Great colleagues! Though unfortunately many have been leaving due to the instability of IBMs HW development business At least in my area theres a high level of flexibility on which projects should I undertake based on my and my management assessment of business impact"
Positive, "IBMs training and mentorship are some of the best in the F500 community and maybe the tech industry as a whole. The people are reasonable the workload is fastpaced and interesting but not at the expense of your health. Pay has become more competitive in recent years leading folks like me to stay for years even when courted by highergrowth startups Overall theres lots to like about IBM. The new CEO Arvind Krishna also seems to have a good handle on what IBM needs to succeed, and he's steering the ship confidently in the right direction after many years previously of stagnant growth"
Positive, "IBM is a consistent company that has been around for a long time with several different areas to move into if you want to change your skills and career options"
Positive, "IBM has the potential to be a leader for good in the way the world works"
Positive, "Phenomenal place for designers Robust support system with great design leadership up to the top as well as a huge network of mentors As an individual contributor I rarely have to waste effort trying to explain to my engineering or PM stakeholders that UX is important but YMMV depending on your team or org Good people culture work life balance decent benefits and pay and career growth opportunities I feel I am treated like a decent human being here and I dont take that for granted"
Positive, "IBMs gives plenty of training opportunities and encourages their workers to constantly upskill If you have the right accounts you can make a lot of money with minimal efforts"
Positive, "Professional Growth and Learning IBM places a strong emphasis on continuous learning and development As a Technical Owner you may have access to training programs certifications and opportunities for professional growth to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends"
Positive, "Pros if there was a pro itd be maybe getting something out of learning on your own if you are allowed the time"
Positive, "Flexibility You can work when and where you want. Control You have control over your business Potential income: You have the potential to earn a lot of money Fulfillment It can be exciting and fulfilling Impact You can positively impact others Skill development You can develop a variety of skills"
Positive, "Large well funded company with decent worker benefits Much of the technology is cutting edge A huge group of smart people"
Negative, "Very corporate Hard to know who to talk to at times"
Negative, "Procrastination Over coming self imposed barriers"
Negative, "Long hours not large enough support teams on each projects. Requiring later nights or weekend work"
Negative, "No promotions Very complex code management"
Negative, "Unfortunately IBM still uses the normal distribution rating system where at the end of the year each employee is ranked as a top contributor 5% above average contributor 15% average contributor 75% and bottom contributor 5% This curve is difficult to apply in the R&D world where you may have many members of the team working long and hard hours and end up being average contributors at the end of the year because there just isnt room for all to be top contributors"
Negative, "Some of the old guard at IBM are stubborn resistant to change and adapt to clients needs But those folks are starting to leave the company. Sales quotas occasionally can be quite aggressive but if you are a nice reasonable person and visibly show effort hustle management can be lenient on performance targets Targets are also subject to change at a moments notice Also promotions can be extremely slow and you have to fight for every new career opportunity Management wont guide you in your career thats up to you and you alone"
Negative, "In consulting they punish people for things that they are not in control of IBM will put people on Performance Improvement Plans because their billable rate is on the low side but if the partners havent sold work for the consultants it is not a performance issue It feels like this is a workaround for unemployment and severance If there isnt work to be done this should be a reduncancy termination that has severance and a positive leaving experience That is not how IBM handles this which is a shame"
Negative, "IBM's leadership has proven over and over again that its always going to be profit over people If IBM ever does anything that confuses you or looks like its against its values just ask yourself if it makes sense from a finance and or legal perspective Usually thats where the decisions come from"
Negative, "Lots of moving parts in this company and releases take a long time 6 months due to technical debt Designs can be handed off often a year or more before something releases Also this is relatively unsexy B2B enterprise work and the complexity is not for everyone Learn to embrace it or you wont do well or be happy here"
Negative, "If you have the wrong account mix or there is no ELA closing for your accounts you can find it really difficult to make your numbers Quota is based on assumptions that are often wrong You will have multiple managers that are mainly interested in forecasting and will often push you towards how they want you to forecast in order to appease their superiors regardless of whether you feel the numbers are accurate"
Negative, "High Workload and Pressure: IBM, being a large and globally recognized company can have high expectations and a fast paced work environment Some employees may feel overwhelmed by the workload and pressure Limited Work-Life Balance In certain roles or during demanding projects employees might find it challenging to maintain a healthy work-life balance Long working hours and tight deadlines may contribute to this issue Bureaucracy Large organizations often have established bureaucratic processes, which could lead to delays in decision making and project execution Navigating through these processes might be cumbersome for some employees Limited Managerial Support Your experience of feeling overworked without sufficient support from management is a common concern in various workplaces In a large company communication channels can sometimes be complex and individual experiences may differ based on teams and managers Emphasis on Metrics Some employees may feel that the company places a strong emphasis on metrics and performance indicators which could potentially impact the work environment and stress levels Limited Flexibility Depending on the role and team, some employees might find that the company has a more structured and less flexible approach to work arrangements Communication Challenges In a large organization communication can sometimes be a challenge Important information might not always be effectively communicated across teams leading to misunderstandings or a lack of clarity"
Negative, "back stabbing is the culture broken promises is all they are good for Work life balance simply can not exist if you were to do your work dedication hard work, and loyalty are meaningless"
